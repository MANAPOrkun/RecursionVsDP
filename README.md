# RecursionVsDP

<b>Task 1</b>

For the given recurrence formula design two algorithms and evaluate their complexity:

• directly applying recursion.

• using the property of dynamic programming – possibility to store partial solutions (memorization). 

Implement in software these two algorithms and experimentally evaluate and compare the time complexity of both algorithms.

<b>Task 2</b>

Following the verbal description of a given task and using the dynamic programming method:

• design the algorithm of a task.

• implement the algorithm in software and experimentally evaluate algorithm’s complexity.

The cells of the square board (n × n) are integers. The snake from the bottom right must face the top left. It can only creep into the box on the left or at the top. 

You need to determine the route with the maximum sum of cells and calculate this sum.

Example:

A =

1 2 3 4

2 2 3 4

3 9 8 4

4 5 6 7

max_path_sum = 36

max_path = 7 6 8 9 3 2 1
